Aim & Objectives

This project focuses on developing an "Internship and Placement Portal with Resume Builder" to streamline the career exploration and job search process for students. The platform aims to empower students by providing an intuitive resume builder, enabling them to easily create professional resumes tailored to specific job requirements. Furthermore, the portal will serve as a central hub for students to discover and apply for internships and job openings from various companies. By facilitating direct interaction between students and recruiters, this platform seeks to bridge the gap between academia and the professional world. The project intends to enhance the overall placement experience for all stakeholders, including students, educational institutions, and recruiters, by minimizing manual efforts and optimizing communication within a single, integrated environment.
